title: To Love A Blogging Platform

>And so, a question was asked. Perhabs not [the oldest question in the universe] (http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Question) - [Doctor Who] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) fans will relate -, but it was a question, and an important one nonetheless, and, unlike The Question from Doctor Who, this one needed to be answered.

A very long time ago, I decided to start a blog. Three long times later, I decided to start a blog. Now, seven long times after, I decided to start a blog.

No, seriously this time.

These ten long times, I always had stuff to do that prevented me from starting that marvelous blog, the most important of which was one oh-so-damn-good bed! Really, when I lie down, you'd have to go through tremendous trouble and effort to get me out of it.

But one of the more serious stuff that has always bugged me was that, giving the fact that I am an insanely-strict perfectionist, I was always on the lookout for the best. And so, for me to decide to start a blog, I had to ask myself the question:

_What is the best blogging platform out there?_

I know, a mind blowing question, right? Ok, not so much.

But it was an important question for me. I wanted something that would be perfect for what I want done, and most of what I was going to do was ramble on about code and programming.

Back then, I wasn't that strict; all I wanted was to just start, and so I started my search.

Google. top blogging platforms. skip the first few ads. Bingo.

I found a few interesting results, and the two most common platforms stood out, as expected; [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) and [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com).

I started a [blog](http://mustafajnr.blogspot.com), and published [my first post](http://mustafajnr.blogspot.com/2013/01/setting-up-blog-horror.html) - a similar rambling to what I am doing here right now -, and made a promise to publish in it once a week, and I lived to fulfill my promise, a year and 4 months later, with [that arabic post about Java classloaders](http://mustafajnr.blogspot.com/2014/05/java-classloaders.html).

Today, I decided to start anew, and to start anew, I had to, once again, ask myself the question, but since I am now more strict as a perfectionist, I altered the question a little bit.

What is the best blogging platform for coders?

That was an interesting twist that made a lot of difference for me, and caused much of my agony today.

Google. top blogging platfoms for coders. Searching instead for top blogging *platforms* for coders. skipping the first few ads. Bingo.

First, there was [that closed question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24231884/best-blogging-platform-for-programmers), that, once again, suggested Wordpress with [this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) for syntax highlighting. There was a mention for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that I didn't look at twice.

Then, there was [that question on Quora](http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-blogging-platform-for-programmers) that had increasing mentions for Jekyll and Github; then there was [that post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069998), and [that post](http://sixrevisions.com/tools/open-source-blogging-platforms-for-developers/). I found alot of people talk about this Jekyll and that Github Pages.

I started digging more into them. I found out that Github Pages is just a place to publish static HTML pages. Not much bloggery, but I can install something that would make it blog-like. That was when I started looking into Jekyll; a static HTML generator using Markdown.

Just what I wanted.

I looked more into how I could install it, and found a link to the installation info I needed bundled at the bottom of Github Pages homepage [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages). Unfortunately, the tutorial missed some important information that kept me frustrated for about three hours (you need to install Ruby, as well as its Development Kit to be able to install json, which, in turn, will help in the installation of Jekyll on your machine). After fixing this problem, I found [this amazing blogpost](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) that pointed me to [this github repo](https://github.com/poole/poole), which rendered my seven hours of work, three hours of frustration included, pointless.

Now comes the best part. Instead of using Github's push & commit routine for blogging, I stumbled upon [this amazing tool](http://prose.io) that makes the operation so much easier, and so familiar to those who are used to the orthodox way of blogging.

All in all, a good experience that taught me to check more tutorials before walking through one. So far, I am enjoying the experience, and I will try to do experiment more, and as much as I can document those experiments.

Anyway, time for the promise. I will try to write once a year, or a century maybe. I just found out about auditing in databases (yes, ***found out*** about it) and right now, I am in the midst of researching the best ways to accomplish such a tast, and I will write about it as soon as I finish that research, and that is a promise.

Now, the new question, Is there any hope that I will finish that research within the lifetime of this universe?

Now that is a good question.
